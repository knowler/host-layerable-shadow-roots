# Host Layerable Shadow Roots

A proposed solution for allowing the styling of shadow roots by the host
context while preserving encapsulation for the shadow root.

This repo is to allow for collaboration around the proposal, ideas for
uses cases, examples, and an attempted polyfill.

- [Proposal](./proposal.md) (work in progress)
- [Polyfill exploration notes](./polyfill.md)
